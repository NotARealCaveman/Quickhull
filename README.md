# Quickhull
C++ Implementation of Quickhull based on Dirk Gregorius' 2014 GDC talk
Working Implementation with face merging. The Quickhull function takes in a point cloud and returns a half edge mesh structure representing the convex hull.
Memory and Epsilon are not dynamic - will fix in the future as well as support for large merge cycles.
